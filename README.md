This is a simple project from The Odin Project: Foundations course, where I apply my current basic knowledge of HTML together with git commands, I will also practice how to write a good and useful git commits.

By the time I will have finished this project I would like to understand more deeply the usage of common HTML stuff like lists, links, images and attributes to these elements.

It is an on-going project, to which I will return again in the CSS section of the course, so it should become better-design as I will be progressing throughout the course.

The main purpose of this project is to really just gasp the very basics of web development, don't expect something sophisticated :D
