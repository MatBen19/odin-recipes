    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make overnight protein oatmeal, combine ½ cup of rolled oats, 1 cup of milk (or a milk alternative), and 1 scoop of protein powder in a jar or bowl. Stir well to fully mix the protein powder, then add 1 tablespoon of chia seeds and a pinch of cinnamon for extra texture and flavor. Mix in any desired sweetener, such as honey or maple syrup, and optional add-ins like berries or nut butter.</p>
    <p>Cover the container and refrigerate overnight, or for at least 6 hours, to allow the oats and chia seeds to absorb the liquid. In the morning, give it a good stir, add extra toppings if you like, and enjoy a ready-to-eat, high-protein breakfast straight from the fridge.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup rolled oats</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
