    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p>To make pancakes, start by whisking together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, beat 1 egg with 1 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined — the batter should be slightly lumpy, not overmixed.</p>
    <p>Heat a lightly buttered nonstick pan over medium heat. Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake, cooking until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2–3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown. Serve warm with maple syrup, fruit, or your favorite toppings.</p>
