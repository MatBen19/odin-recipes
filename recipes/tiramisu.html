    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make tiramisu, start by whisking together 3 large egg yolks and ½ cup of sugar until pale and creamy. Gently fold in 250 g of mascarpone cheese until smooth. In a separate bowl, whip 1 cup of heavy cream until soft peaks form, then fold it into the mascarpone mixture. Prepare 1 cup of strong coffee and let it cool, optionally adding 1–2 tablespoons of coffee liqueur. Quickly dip ladyfinger biscuits into the coffee — don’t soak them or they’ll fall apart.</p>
    <p>Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a dish, then spread half of the mascarpone mixture on top. Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone cream. Smooth the surface, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4–6 hours (overnight is best) to let the flavors meld. Just before serving, dust generously with cocoa powder.</p>
